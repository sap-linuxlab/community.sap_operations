## Collection wide ansible-lint configuration file.
# Changes for ansible-lint v25.7.0+
# - Always executed from collection root using collection configuration.
# - .ansible-lint-ignore can be used to ignore files, not folders.
## Execution examples:
# ansible-lint
# ansible-lint roles/sap_firewall
# ansible-lint roles/sap_firewall -c roles/sap_firewall/.ansible-lint

  - .ansible/
  - .cache/
  - .github/
  - changelogs/
  - playbooks/
  - tests/
  # sap_rfc role is excluded because it is no longer supported.
  - roles/sap_rfc
